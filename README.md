[h1]Features[/h1]
• Train your colonist's melee and shooting skills by attacking combat dummies.
• Prioritize combat training like any other type of work.
• Train with real weapons or craft training weapons that cause no damage.  There is no friendly fire in either case.
• Add a combat dummy to a room to give that room the Combat Training Room role.
• Get a mood buff for having an impressive Combat Training Room.
• Colonists will automatically try and equip a training weapon if there is one near the dummy they are going to train on (the weapons don't need to be on a shelf or in a zone).  
? ? The colonist will try and pick up a training weapon of the same type that they are holding (melee or ranged).  
? ? If they are not carrying a weapon, they wil try to equip a melee training weapon.  
? ? If a colonist can't find a training weapon of the same type they are holding, they will try and find a melee training weapon first and then a ranged training weapon.
• Colonists will requip their original weapon after done training, unless drafted or forced to do other work.
• While training, colonists will take a quick break to check for other jobs or satisfy needs.  This causes them to switch back to their old weapon and if there are no jobs or needs, the colonist picks up the training weapon again and continues training.
• Colonists won't train if their skill level has been saturated for the day (4000xp).  For a colonist with burning passion, this takes about 2 hours, for a colonist with passion about 3 hours and for one with no passion, saturation takes all day.  Leave your comments about this restriction.

[h1]Usage[/h1]
1. Construct a combat dummy (or several).
  a. Combat dummies are located in the Misc tab.
2. Designate a combat dummy with the Train Combat designation.
  a. Select the combat dummy or dummies you want to designate for combat training and then click the train combat button or use the orders many to drag select several dummies
3. Open the work tab and make sure to prioritize Train Combat as desired
  a. Your colonist will use their currently equipped weapon to attack the dummies.
  b. Equip a training weapon to avoid damaging the combat dummies.  Training knives can be created at a craft spot and smithy, while training BB rifles need to be crafted at a machining table.

[h1]Balancing[/h1]
Combat training grants about the same xp as actual combat.  This is balanced by making it a work type. Colonists won't be doing any other work when training combat, plus it costs resources to create a dummy and training weapons.  Additionally, combat training end after skill saturation (4000xp per day for combat skills).
